        <h1>American Irrationalism</h1>
        <address>By Chris Hedges</address>
        <blockquote>"There is no shortage of signs of impending environmental
        catastrophe, including the melting of the polar ice caps and the rise of
        atmospheric carbon to above 400 parts per million".</blockquote>
        </header>
        <p>The earth’s sixth mass extinction is underway. It is not taking place
        because of planetary forces. Homo sapiens is orchestrating it. Americans
        are at the same time bankrupting themselves by waging endless and
        unwinnable wars. We have allowed our elites to push more than half the
        U.S. population into poverty through deindustrialization. We do nothing
        to halt the waves of nihilistic violence by enraged citizens who carry
        out periodic mass shootings in schools, malls, movie theaters and other
        public places. The political and financial elites flaunt their greed and
        corruption. Donald Trump appears to pay no federal income taxes. Hillary
        and Bill Clinton use their foundation as a tool for legalized bribery.
        Our largest corporations have orchestrated a legal tax boycott. The
        judicial system is a subsidiary of the corporate state. Militarized
        police conduct public executions of unarmed people of color. Our
        infrastructure, including our schools, roads and bridges, along with our
        deindustrialized cities, are in ruins. Decay and rot—physical and
        moral—are pervasive.</p>
        <p>We are blinded to our depressing reality by the avalanche of images
        disseminated by mass media. Political, intellectual and cultural
        discourse has been replaced with spectacle. Emotionalism and
        sensationalism are prized over truth. Highly paid pundits who parrot
        back the official narrative, corporate advertisers, inane talk shows,
        violent or sexually explicit entertainment and gossip-fueled news have
        contaminated cultural life. “Reality” television, as contrived as every
        other form of mass entertainment, has produced a “reality” presidential
        candidate.</p>
        <p>Mass culture, because it speaks to us in easily digestible clichés
        and stereotypes, reinforces ignorance, bigotry and racism. It promotes
        our individual and collective self-glorification. It sanctifies
        nonexistent national virtues. It takes from us the intellectual and
        linguistic tools needed to separate illusion from truth. It is all show
        business all the time.</p>
        <p>There are millions of Americans who know that something is terribly
        wrong. A light has gone out. They see this in their own suffering and
        hopelessness and the suffering and hopelessness of their neighbors. But
        they lack, because of the contamination of our political, cultural and
        intellectual discourse, the words and ideas to make sense of what is
        happening around them. They are bereft of a vision. Austerity,
        globalization, unfettered capitalism, an expansion of the extraction of
        fossil fuels, and war are not the prices to be paid for progress and the
        advance of civilization. They are part of the savage and deadly
        exploitation by corporate capitalism and imperialism. They serve a
        neoliberal ideology. The elites dare not speak this truth. It is toxic.
        They peddle the seductive illusions that saturate the airwaves. We are
        left to strike out at shadows. We are led to succumb to the racism,
        allure of white supremacy and bigotry that always accompany a culture in
        dissolution.</p>
        <p>We cannot, for this reason, discount the possibility that Trump will
        be elected president. The election outcome will be decided by whatever
        emotion Americans feel when they cast their ballots. </p>
        <p>Celebrity narratives, manufactured pseudo-drama, sex scandals,
        natural disasters, insults and invective, mass shootings and war flash
        before us in a constant jumble of images on ubiquitous screens. The
        sensory assault obliterates reality. A former congressman who sends a
        picture of himself in underwear to a woman is a national news story.
        Sober examinations of our economic, foreign, judicial and environmental
        policies are dismissed as too complicated and boring. They do not
        produce engaging images. The electronic media’s sole goal is to attract
        viewers and advertising dollars. It has conditioned us to demand a
        nonstop vaudeville act.</p>
        <p>Because of this mass indoctrination, we have become infected by what
        Daniel Boorstin in “The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America”
        calls “social narcissism.” The bottomless narcissism of Trump and the
        Clintons caters to this social narcissism. They reflect back to us our
        desperate longing for, as well as celebration of, entertainment,
        celebrity, wealth, power and self-aggrandizement. It is not only
        advertising and public relations, as Boorstin pointed out, that carry
        out the incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social
        narcissism. Journalists, book publishers, politicians, athletes,
        entertainers, positive psychologists, self-help gurus, the Christian
        right and talk show hosts all feed the mania for illusion. They all
        chant the insane mantra that reality is never an impediment to what we
        desire. We can have anything we want if we work hard, get an education,
        believe in ourselves, grasp that we are exceptional and see the
        impossible as always possible. It is magical thinking. And magical
        thinking is the only real commodity the elites have left to offer us.
        Make American Great Again. Or American already is great. Take your pick
        of idiotic clichés.</p>
        <p>“We tyrannize and frustrate ourselves by expecting more than the
        world can give us or than we can make of the world,” Boorstin wrote. “We
        demand that everyone who talks to us, or writes for us, or takes
        pictures for us, or makes merchandise for us, should live in our world
        of extravagant expectations. We expect this even of the peoples of
        foreign countries. We have become so accustomed to our illusions that we
        mistake them for reality. We demand them. And we demand that there be
        always more of them, bigger and better and more vivid.”</p>
        <p>The incessant search for instant gratification and the most appealing
        image, including the image of ourselves we manufacture for others on
        social media, has robbed us of the ability to examine ourselves and our
        society. It has extinguished the truth. The terminal decline of the
        American empire, the utter inability our elites to manage anything
        important, the climate crisis, widespread poverty and despair do not fit
        with the illusion. So these realities are blotted from public
        consciousness. The poor are rendered invisible. The foreign policy
        debacles will be fixed with more bombs. Only the Soviet and fascist
        dictatorships, along with the medieval Catholic Church, controlled
        thought as effectively.</p>
        <p>Candidates Trump and Clinton have no plans to halt our slide to
        oblivion. They are part of the circus. They, like all of the other
        elites, profit from the system that is destroying us. They lack the
        incentive and probably the capacity to challenge the structures and
        assumptions that define corporate capitalism. They function as high
        priests. They peddle the illusions. They laud our ingenuity and
        strength. They preach the inevitability of human progress and American
        exceptionalism. They tell us what we want to hear. They appeal to our
        emotions, as does all of mass culture. They do not acknowledge reality.
        That would spoil the show.</p>
        <p>We vote for slogans, manufactured personalities, perceived sincerity,
        personal attractiveness and the crafted personal narratives peddled by
        candidates. Office seekers create the illusion of intimacy established
        between celebrities and their audiences. We see ourselves in them;
        admirers of the “winner” Trump see themselves as becoming him. No
        politician succeeds without such artifice. Today’s politics is just one
        more product of a diseased culture. Our political leaders are much like
        the celebrities who, in Boorstin’s words, “are receptacles into which we
        pour our own purposelessness. They are nothing but ourselves seen in a
        magnifying mirror.”</p>
        <p>The incoherent absurdities mouthed for our amusement induce a state
        of permanent amnesia. Life is lived in an eternal present. How we got
        here, where we came from, what shaped us as a society, in short the
        continuum of history that gives us an identity, are eradicated.</p>
        <p>The quest for identity through mass culture is self-defeating. We can
        never achieve what these illusions tell us we can achieve. We can never
        be who we want to be. It is a ceaseless chase from one chimera to the
        next. And this is why at the end we fall into despair and rage. It is
        why huge parts of the country no longer hold genuine political ideas. It
        is why people vote according to how they feel. It is why hatred and fear
        are a potent political platform. It is why we are sleepwalking into
        oblivion.</p>
